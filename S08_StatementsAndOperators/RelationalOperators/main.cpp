NOTES ON RELATIONAL OPERATORS
=====================================================================

Relational operators compare two operands and return a boolean result:
true (condition satisfied) or false (condition not satisfied).

- These operators can be used with all built-in numeric types (int, float, double, etc.)
  and even characters (based on ASCII values).
- They are often used in conditions for `if`, `while`, and other control statements.

Example:
    if (score >= 90)
        cout << "Excellent!" << endl;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips:
- Always use `==` for equality and `!=` for inequality.
  Using `=` instead of `==` is a common bug (itâ€™s assignment, not comparison).
- Use `boolalpha` for more readable boolean output (prints true/false).
- Parentheses around comparisons make complex expressions clearer.
